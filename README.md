ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Facundo

I'm currently working on my Master's Degree in plasma physics. Basically, I'm trying to understand the advantages of different geometries (positive and negative triangularity) in nuclear fusion reactors such as ITER. Doing so requires calculating the plasma equilibria for those geometries and simulating the dynamics of multiple particles inside the reactor. I mostly code on C++ and Python, and I find programming to be quite fun. Aside from that I love trekking, swimming and reading whenever I can.
